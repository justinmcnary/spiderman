         <h4>History</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Spider-Man is the quintessential Marvel character. Although a superhero, he is spared none of the slings and arrows of ordinary life; he experiences difficulties with friends, family, sweethearts and employers. His powers enable him to do good, but
         not to improve his own lot in life, and it is his simple humanity, rather than his exotic talents, that has won him millions of enthusiastic fans. He is one superhero who has not lost the common touch and, in fact, he is frequently described as "your
         friendly neighborhood Spider-Man."
      </p>
      <p>In his 1962 debut, Spider-Man took to fighting crime for a reason commonplace in comc books: he was motivated by the murder of a father figure, his Uncle Ben. Yet Spidey's driving force is guilt, not revenge; he must live forever with the knowledge
         that he could have prevented the killing if he had not been so self-absorbed. Perhaps he suffers from a classic Oedipus complex. In any case, he is certainly neurotic, forever agonizing over the choices that confront him when he attempts to do the
         right thing. Despite his best efforts, he is viewed with a touch of suspicion by those in authority, and is sometimes considered little more than a criminal himself.
      </p>
      <p>Although nobody seems to understand him, Spider-Man has the spirit to be a joker as well as a tragic figure. He is quick with a quip, appreciates the irony of his endless predicaments, and relishes the chance to play tricks on people who never suspect
         that he and Peter Parker are one and the same.
      </p>
      <p>As originally depicted by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Peter Parker was just a bit of a wimp. Bright, imaginative, but nonetheless an alienated adolescent, he might well have been a typical comic book reader, although he has matured and gained
         confidence over the years.
      </p>
      <p>Spidey is still all too human. He misses appointments, catches the flu when he needs to fight, forgets to put film in his camera and has trouble paying the rent. In short, Spider-Man remains "the superhero who could be you."</p>

               <div class="caption">
                  <p><em>The Amazing Spider-Man #121-122</em></p>
                  <p>This was a storyline so iconic that it ended the Silver Age of comics, ushering in a more grounded, realistic Bronze Age, more akin to comics today.</p>
                  <p>During a battle between Spidey and the Green Goblin (one of his greatest nemeses), the love of Peter Parker's life, Gwen Stacy, is killed. Worse yet, the way things played out, Peter will never know if she accidentally died by his own hand,
                     or if the Goblin had already killed her. This is arguably the most defining moment in Spider-Man's life, save for the death of his Uncle Ben, and is the definitive Spider-Man story.

               <p><em>Web of Spider-Man #31-32, The Amazing Spider-Man #293-294, The Spectacular Spider-Man #131-132. 
                  </em>
               </p>
               <p>Kraven the Hunter goes from B-list bad guy to a top Spidey foe in this incredible psychological thriller. Kraven achieves his greatest goal: he hunts, defeats, and buries his arch rival, Spider-Man. He then takes up the mantle of Spider-Man for
                  a time, to prove he is superior. During this time he defeats and tortures Vermin. Then, having nothing left to live for, he leaves a note for the police letting them know he had been running around as Spider-Man, and commits suicide with a rifle.
                  Dark, haunting, and real. A must read.
